rockhoppers
===========

These projects are an unfiltered dump of demos and code snippets of everything that was sitting on my desktop.

There is a mixture of Java, Ruby and JavaScript in here - some projects should have a README.md but you know...

The orginal workspace was rockhoppers with a pom to open other projects - but I got away from that quite quickly :(
